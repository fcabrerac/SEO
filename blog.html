				<h1>The History of Artificial Inteligence</h1>
				<p>
                    OpenAI, the artificial intelligence research organization founded by Elon Musk, claimed one of many to come world first: its artificial intelligence 
                    system trained to play the complex strategy game Dota 2 has bested a world champion e-sports 
                    team. The competition was held in the bay area and dubbed the OpenAI Five Finals, ending 
                    the organization’s public demonstrations of its Dota-playing technology on a high note. 
                </p> <br>
            
                <p>The competition on the human side included five top Dota 2 pros from team OG, which won 
                    the world’s most extreme e-sports prize last year when it took the Number one spot at The 
                    International competition, the premiere annual Dota 2 tournament with prizes now reaching $25 million usd. 
                    OG faced off in a best of three matches against the OpenAI Five bots, all trained using the 
                    same deep reinforcement learning techniques and controlled independently by different layers 
                    of the same system.
