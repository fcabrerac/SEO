          <h1>The History of Artificial Inteligence</h1> 
      </div>
    <p>
        The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular 
        today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing 
        power and storage.
    </p>

    <p>Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. 
        In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began 
        training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research 
        Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent 
        personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.
    </p>
        
    <p>This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, 
        including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and 
        augment human abilities.

        While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots that
        take over the world, the current evolution of AI technologies isn’t that scary – or quite that 
        smart. Instead, AI has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry. Keep reading 
        for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care, retail and more.

        </h3>
        Neural networks are computing systems with interconnected nodes 
        that work much like neurons in the human brain. Using algorithms, 
        they can recognize hidden patterns and correlations in raw data, 
        cluster and classify it, and – over time – continuously learn and improve.

    <h1>MACHINE LEARNING</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>
            1980s–2010s
        </h3>
        Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical 
        model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the 
        idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make 
        decisions with minimal human intervention.
    </p>
    <h1>DEEP LEARNING</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>
           2010s-Present Day
        </h3>
        Deep learning is a type of machine learning that trains a computer 
        to perform human-like tasks, such as recognizing speech, identifying 
        images or making predictions. Instead of organizing data to run through
         predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the 
         data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns 
         using many layers of processing.
