				<h1>The History of Artificial Inteligence</h1>
				<p>
                    The term artificial intelligence was introduced in 1956, but artificial intelligence has become more and more popular 
                    today, thanks to increased data volumes, new and advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing 
                    power and even storage.
                </p> <br>
            
                <p>Early artificial intelligence research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. 
                    In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began 
                    training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research 
                    Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent 
                    personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.
                </p> <br>
                    
                <p>This early work strated the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, 
                    including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and 
                    augment human abilities.
                </p> <br>
                    
                <p>
                    While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict artificial intelligence as robots that
                    take over the world, the current evolution of artificial intelligence technologies isn’t that scary, 
                    quite the contrary. Instead, it has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry. There 
                    are three phases in which artificial intelligence could be divided based on the main topic of research of the scientist

                    Deep learning is a type of machine learning that trains a computer 
                    to perform human-like tasks, such as recognizing speech, identifying 
                    images or making predictions. Instead of organizing data to run through
                     predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the 
                     data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns 
                     using many layers of processing.
