				<h3>
					Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines 
					capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with
					multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in 
					virtually every sector of the tech industry. 
				</h3>
				<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs a
					nd perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to 
					self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, 
					computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing 
					patterns in the data.</p>

				<h1 class="titulo">How Does Artificial Intelligence Work?</h1>
				<p>Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II,
					mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?". Turing's paper
					"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and
					 vision of artificial intelligence.
				</p>
				<p> At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is 
					the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. The expansive goal of artificial intelligence 
					has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.     
					The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually 
					explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent? In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial
					Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work 
					around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive 
					percepts from the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)
				  </p>
				  <p>Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI: 
					<ul> 
					<li>Thinking humanly</li>
					<li>Thinking rationally</li>
					<li>Acting humanly </li>
					<li> Acting rationally </li>
				  </ul>
				  </p>
            </article>
            
            <article>
				<h1 class="titulo">How is AI Used?</h1>
				<p>
					The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell 
					focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, noting "all the skills needed for the 
					Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4).                
					Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines AI as  
					"algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that 
					tie thinking, perception and action together."
				</p>
				<p>
					While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help focus the field as an area of 
					computer science and provide a blueprint for infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other 
					subsets of artificial intelligence. While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017,  DataRobot 
					CEO Jeremy Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how AI is used today:
					"AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial 
					intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are 
					powered by very boring things like rules."

				<h1 class="titulo">What do you think about artificial intelligence?</h1>
				<p>
					Everything that can be done in life is through the processing that we human beings have when analyzing each situation; 
					For this reason we interpret that we are the most intelligent species on the planet. Over the years, 
					humans have achieved technological developments, to fulfill dreams that people thought were impossible, 
					which is the development of artificial intelligence.

				<h1 class="titulo">The future with artificial intelligence</h1>
				<p>
					Intelligence is the most powerful tool of our species, 
					where we can stand out from the rest. Currently, 
					heavy labor is being exchanged for intelligent or artificial labor.
					What will happen to humanity? Over the years, 
					computing will be automated and tasks will be classified 
					for each individual with incredible artificial processing;
					Every day you will learn more about technological engineering 
					through simpler algorithms to learn.
