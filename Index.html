				<h1>Artificial Inteligence</h1> <br>

				<h3>
					Artificial intelligence (AI) is complex and diverse branch of computer science focused with building machines 
					capable of performing tasks that otherwise would require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with
					multiple approaches and branches, but advancements in lieds like machine learning and deep learning are creating a 
					paradigm shift in pratically every sector of computer science and also all the tech industry. 
				</h3> 
				<br>
				<p> Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to "learn" from experience, adjust to new inputs a
					nd perform human-like tasks and also replicate behaviours similar to that of the humans or animals they are programmed to replicate.
					Most artificial intelligence examples and news that you hear about today, from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars, rely heavily on deep 
					learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific 
					tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.</p>

			<h1 class="titulo">How Does Artificial Intelligence really Work?</h1>
				<p> After breaking the Nazi encryption machine called Enigma and helping the Allied Forces turn the tides and win World War II,
					mathematician Alan Turing changed history again with a simple question: "Can machines think?". Turing's paper named:
					"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent creation of the Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and
					 vision of artificial intelligence. still to this day the benchmark for artifical intelligence is to pass this test.
				</p>
				<p> So, at it's core, artificial intelligence is a branch of the field of computer science that aims to answer positively Turing's question.
					It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in computer and other machines. The expansive goal of this field 
					has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that there's not an unique and singular definition of the field is accepted generally.     
					The major limitation in defining artificial intelligence as just "building machines that are sentient and intelligent" is that it doesn't actually 
					explain what artificial intelligence is? What does makes a machine intelligent? In their groundbreaking textbook "Artificial
					Intelligence: A Modern Approach", authors Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell approach the question by unifying their work 
					around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, acording to Russell and Novig, artificial intelligence is "the study of agents that receive 
					percepts from the environment and perform actions." 
				  </p>
				  <p>Norvig and Russell go on to postule and explore the four different approaches that, historically, have defined the field of artificial intelligence: 
					  <br>
					  <br>
					<ul> 
					<li>Thinking humanly</li>
					<li>Thinking rationally</li>
					<li>Acting humanly </li>
					<li>Acting rationally </li>
				  </ul>
				  </p>
				  <br>
            </article>
            
            <article>
				<h1 class="titulo">How is Artificial Intelligence Used?</h1>
				<p>
					The first two ideas concern thought related processes and reasonings, while the others deal with behavior and actions. Norvig and Russell 
					focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, they said "all the skills needed for the 
					Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally."                
					Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines artificial intelligence as 
					"algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that 
					tie thinking, perception and action together."
				</p>
				<p>
					While these definitions may seem abstract or complex to the average joe, they help focus the field as an area of 
					computer science and provide the basis for infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other 
					subsets of artificial intelligence. While addressing the crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017,  DataRobot 
					CEO Jeremy Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how artificial intelligence is used today:
					"Artificial Inteligence is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial 
					intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are 
					powered by very boring things like rules."

				<h1>The future with artificial intelligence</h1> <br>

				<p>
					Intelligence is the most powerful tool of our species, 
					where we can stand out from the rest. Currently, 
					heavy labor is being exchanged for intelligent or artificial labor.
					What will happen to humanity? Over the years, 
					computing will be automated and tasks will be classified 
					for each individual with incredible artificial processing;
					Every day you will learn more about technological engineering 
					through simpler algorithms to learn.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Everything that can be done in life is through the processing that we human beings have when analyzing each situation; 
					For this reason we interpret that we are the most intelligent species on the planet. Over the years, 
					humans have achieved technological developments, to fulfill dreams that people thought were impossible, 
					which is the development of artificial intelligence.
